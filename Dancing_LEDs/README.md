Dancing LEDS
================

A project to control flexible RGB LPD8806 LED pixel strips using Arduino and synchronise them to music

The Arduino Uno here uses the FastSPI2 library at https://code.google.com/p/fastspi/

This project uses a MIDI track to generate timings, which are provided by the computer to an Arduino. The Arduino then programs the RGB LED strip to create sync between the audio and visuals.
