WebClient
=========

A simple Arduino + Ethernet Shield project to implement GET and POST requests to your custom appspot Google App Engine page.
This also implements posting to a Google Docs Spreadsheet from the Arduino
This example also includes support for pushing to a COSM application now.

I use this to get information from the server, or post data from sensors to servers,for external application.
You can also use COSM to push your data to a live feed, where you can then do visualization,and use it trigger other servers or post to Twitter streams
