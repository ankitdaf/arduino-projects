WebClient
=========

A simple Arduino + Ethernet Shield project to implement GET and POST requests to your custom appspot Google App Engine page. This also implements posting to a Google Docs Spreadsheet from the Arduino

I use this to get information from the server, or post data from sensors to servers,for external application.
